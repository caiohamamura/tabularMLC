\title{Tabular maximum likelihood classifier}
\description{
Maximum likelihood is a common classifier used for land use classification.
It calculates the likelihood of an object to belong to each class based on
an expected distribution and a metric of distance.
}
\details{
The most common implementation, like in this package, will assume normal
distributed variables within classes, and calculate the distance, based
on Mahalanobis distance.
