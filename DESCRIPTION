Description: 
  The maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) is one of the most common classifiers used for 
  remote sensing imagery. 
  This package uses 'RcppArmadillo' to provide a fast implementation of the MLC to train 
  and predict over tabular data (data.frame).
  The algorithms were based on Mather (1985) <doi:10.1080/01431168508948456> method.
